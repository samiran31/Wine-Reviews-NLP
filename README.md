# Wine-Reviews-NLP

In this repository I have attached three kernals :

1)Wine Descriptions with NLP and kMeans: As the name suggests we will be using NLP to understand the sentiment then will be using unsupervised learning(kmeans) to get the wines which are similar to each other.

2)Wine reviews:- This kernal has details EDA and feature engineering of all the features. Helps to understand what the dataset is actually about. Finally we have built a recommendation system for us where we find the wines which are similar to a given wine.

3)Spacy Wine reviews:- Spacy has been used to understand wine reviews.
